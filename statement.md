1.) Problem Statement :
In today’s digital life, many people use simple and weak passwords like "12345", "abcd", or their name. These passwords are easy to guess and unsafe. Because of this, accounts can be hacked easily.  
To solve this problem, a tool is needed that can generate strong, random, and secure passwords automatically.

This project creates a Password Generator that gives the user a strong password based on the length they want. The password includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This helps users make safer accounts and protect their data.

2.) Scope of the Project :
This project is small but useful. It will help users quickly create strong passwords for any online account.  
The scope includes:

- Generating random passwords based on user input.
- Allowing users to choose the password length.
- Making passwords that include letters, digits, and symbols.
- Showing the generated password on the screen.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code using Python.

This project focuses only on password creation, not storing or managing passwords.

3.) Target Users :
This project is designed for:

- Students who need quick strong passwords.
- Normal users who make accounts on social media, apps, or websites.
- Anyone who wants a secure password for personal or professional use.
- Beginners who want to understand how random password generators work.

4.) High-Level Features :
This Password Generator includes the following main features:

1. *User Input for Length*  
   The user can choose how long the password should be.

2. *Random Character Selection*  
   The program automatically selects letters, numbers, and symbols.

3. *Strong Password Output*  
   The final password is strong, unique, and hard to guess.

4. *Simple Interface*  
   Just run the Python file and enter the required length.

5. *Error Handling*  
   If the user gives invalid length, it shows a message.
