1.)  **Problem Statement**


In daily life, I noticed that many people (including myself earlier) tend to use weak or repeated passwords. This increases the risk of hacking, data theft, and personal account breaches. To solve this issue, I decided to develop a Random Password Generator that can instantly create strong, unpredictable, and secure passwords based on user preferences.

2.) **Scope of the Project**


The scope of this project includes:
- Creating a Python-based tool that generates secure passwords  
- Allowing users to choose their desired password length  
- Ensuring the password contains a mix of characters  
- Validating user input  
- Designing the project in multiple modules for clarity and future expansion  
- Keeping the system simple so even beginners can use it  

The project does *not* include saving passwords, online encryption, or GUI development (but these can be added later).

3.) **Target Users**


This project is mainly helpful for:
- Students who want to create strong passwords  
- Anyone who struggles to think of secure passwords  
- Developers who want a simple command-line password generator  
- Users who want privacy without depending on online tools  

4.) **High-Level Features**


- User can input desired password length  
- Automatic validation for minimum and maximum limits  
- Random mixing of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols  
- Modular Python code with separate files for each function  
- Easy to run in any environment  
- Can be expanded into a GUI or web version in the future
