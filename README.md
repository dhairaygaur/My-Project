1.) **Project Tittle : Random Password Generator**


2.) **Project Overview**
I built this Random Password Generator to create secure and unpredictable passwords based on user-defined preferences. The project is simple, modular, and uses multiple Python files so that each responsibility is separated clearly. My goal was to design something lightweight, easy to understand, and useful for anyone who wants stronger password habits.


3.) **Features**
- Generates strong random passwords
- User chooses the password length
- Includes letters, digits, and symbols
- Validates user input
- Modular code with multiple Python files
- Simple command-line interface
- Easily extendable for more features later


4.) **Technologies / Tools Used** 
- *Python 3*
- *VS Code* (for writing and testing code)
- *Git & GitHub* (for version control and hosting)
- *Random module (Python standard library)*
  

5.) **Steps to Install & Run the Project**

a. Clone the Repository.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

b. Open the folder in VS Code

c. Run the main program

python main.py

d. Enter the required inputs

- Enter password length  
- View the generated password in the terminal
  

6.) **Instructions for Testing**
I wrote small validation and generation tests inside the tests/ folder. You can run them using:

python tests/test_generator.py python tests/test_validator.py

These tests help me verify:
- The password length is valid  
- The generated password contains mixed characters  
- The functions are working correctly
